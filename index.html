                    <p>
                        Da Lat is one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in Vietnam, and it's a mix of old French buildings, gorgeous flower gardens, and some seriously amazing mountains where we can hike and enjoy beautiful views of the city. My family always went to Dalat for family vacations every year because of the memories of my Dad's journey when he was young. Every time we leave Da Lat, we're not just taking pictures and souvenirs.  We're taking back a stronger connection to our family and a real love for this awesome place.

                    <p>
                        Having a great time living in Melbourne, Australia, I had a chance to visit Great Ocean Road - it hugs the seaside cliffs that snake along the wild and windswept Southern Ocean. The roads cut right into these massive cliffs that drop straight down to the ocean, offering commanding views of the waves from Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean swelling and crashing onto the rocks and beaches below. I had a great time visiting Great Ocean Road in 2022 with my friends for 1 day; that was the best day ever since I lived in Australia. The most interesting one was the 12 Apostles - a fantastic collection of rock formations carved out of the headland by the fierce waves of the Southern Ocean.

                <p>
                    Moving to Canada, I had a great chance to explore more about the world. Last year, I went to Canmore, which is located one hour West of Calgary and only 5 minutes from Banff National Park. With my friends, we explore hiking trails, indulge in local delicacies at quaint cafes, and immerse ourselves in the vibrant arts scene of this picturesque mountain town. Canmore also has this cool, artsy vibe, so we wandered around some galleries and checked out what was happening.  It's a pretty little mountain town, and we had such a great time to chill during semester break
